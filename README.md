> Tak is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by [James Ernest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ernest) and [Patrick Rothfuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Rothfuss) and published by [Cheapass Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheapass_Games) in 2016. It was designed based on a description of a fictional game in Patrick Rothfuss' 2011 fantasy novel [The Wise Man's Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man%27s_Fear).[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_(game)#cite_note-1)]

> The objective of Tak is to be the first player to connect any two opposite edges of the board with your pieces, called "stones", creating a road. To this end, players will take turns blocking and capturing their opponent's pieces while supporting and connecting their own pieces to build their road. When a player "captures" a stone, the stones stack on top of each other and this creates a three dimensional element to the game play.

This package is **WIP** and is attempting to implement all Tak rules, exposing an easy API to verify moves and get the current game state.
